<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As programmers, we have long learned that Duplication is the Ultimate Sin of programming. Even considering to duplicate something is almost unthinkable.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  But removing duplication introduces dependencies. If you and I use the reuse the same piece of code instead of duplicating it, changes I make may affect you. This effect can anything from beneficial (I fixed a bug you also needed fixing) to benign (I added a new feature that you’re not using) to detrimental (I want it to work in a way that’s no good for you).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  When we have dependencies, we have to think: “Perhaps I shouldn’t add that feature – what if breaks something for someone else?” “Damn the torpedoes, I’m hacking it in!” or “Perhaps I’ll just make a fork for my changes and we’ll merge later”.<!--more-->
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Sometimes benign, sometimes harmfull.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I recently discussed with a friend the case of being innovative in the face of legacy code. Remember: Legacy code is code that you don’t want to touch, because it’s dangerous to change and it gives value to the business now.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We want to gradually build a new platform. So it seems like we have two choices: We could make the new code call functionality on the old platform (ick! because, you know, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_holes">stop digging</a>“) or we could build a new service and change the old system to use it (OMG! because, you know, “dangerous to change”).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If we allow the new system to duplicate as much functionality as needed from the old system, this false dicotomy goes away.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Duplication isn’t a cardinal sin. It’s a negative property, but in many cases, it could be your best option.
